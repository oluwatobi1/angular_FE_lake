  <h1 class="text-center">Project Results</h1>

  <p>
    We achieved a high accuracy of 91% on the 1,100 testing images for our CT Scan Deep Learning project returning both a confidence and prediction score to determine positive or negative covid19 infection. <br><br>

Secondly, over 50% of the countries we predicted for the next outbreak of covid19 is currently in either a partial or full lockdown mode. <a routerLink="/Analytics-Forecasting">Check details here</a> <br><br>

In addition to containing the virus, policies are peculiar to respective countries in effectiveness. In the Netherlands for example, from June 2020 the virus has been on the increase rapidly unlike Taiwan from the same month with closely related mobility restriction and stringency measures. <br><br>

These results will affect the field of medical imaging with previous breakthroughs in the field of Deep Learning for diseases like; Cancer, Pneumonia, ARDS, MERS, and SARS. Also, it reveals deep insight on Improving societal response to the pandemic spread by the creation of unique and timely policies per country. Clinical insights and identification will also improve beyond swab tests. <br><br>

Subsequently, this provides the world with detailed methodologies around the containment of infectious diseases, and response to pandemics so as to be better prepared for any likely future infectious disease recurrence.
